# ECE549-Computer-Vision-Machine Problem 

In the simplest terms, computer vision is the discipline of “teaching machines how to see.” This field dates back more than fifty years, but the recent explosive growth of digital imaging and machine learning technologies makes the problems of automated image interpretation more exciting and relevant than ever. There are two major themes in the computer vision literature: 3D geometry and recognition. This course provide a coherent perspective on the different aspects of computer vision, and give us the ability to understand state-of-the-art vision literature and implement components that are fundamental to many modern vision systems.

There are totally 5 machine problems including in this course.
